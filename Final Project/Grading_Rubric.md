## Grading Philosophy

This rubric evaluates:
- ✅ **Does it work?** - Functionality matters
- ✅ **Is the code clean?** - Quality over quantity
- ✅ **Did you apply OOP?** - Show what you learned
- ✅ **Can others understand it?** - Documentation counts
- ✅ **Did you challenge yourself?** - Passion projects shine

**Note**: Simple projects executed excellently score higher than complex projects done poorly.

## 📋 Detailed Scoring Criteria

### 1. Functionality & Completion (25 points)

#### Does the project work as intended?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **23-25 pts** (Excellent) | Project runs flawlessly. All planned features work perfectly. Handles edge cases gracefully. Zero critical bugs. Goes above and beyond basic requirements. |
| **20-22 pts** (Very Good) | Project works very well. Core features all functional. Minor bugs that don't affect main functionality. Most edge cases handled. |
| **17-19 pts** (Good) | Project works with some issues. Core features functional but may have bugs. Some edge cases cause problems. Needs polish but demonstrates competence. |
| **14-16 pts** (Satisfactory) | Project works but has multiple bugs. Core functionality present but unreliable. Many edge cases not handled. Needs significant debugging. |
| **10-13 pts** (Needs Work) | Project partially works. Some features broken or missing. Frequent errors. Core functionality incomplete. |

| **17-19 pts** (Good) | Code is readable with some organization. Decent naming. Some inconsistent styling. Basic comments present. Some redundancy. Some functions could be better organized. |
| **14-16 pts** (Satisfactory) | Code works but is messy. Poor naming in places. Inconsistent style. Minimal comments. Some confusing sections. Functions too long or poorly organized. |
| **10-13 pts** (Needs Work) | Code is hard to read. Poor naming throughout. Little to no comments. Inconsistent or no style. Large blocks of repetitive code. Very long functions. |
| **0-9 pts** (Poor) | Code is unreadable. No clear organization. Terrible naming. No comments. Cannot follow code logic. Massive functions doing too much. |

### 3. OOP Concepts & Design (25 points)

#### Does the project demonstrate understanding of object-oriented programming?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **23-25 pts** (Excellent) | Outstanding OOP design. 3+ well-designed classes with clear purposes. Perfect encapsulation (private variables, proper getters/setters). If using Java: inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction all demonstrated beautifully. If other language: clear class-based structure showing OOP understanding. Separation of concerns is exceptional. |
| **20-22 pts** (Very Good) | Strong OOP implementation. 2-3 solid classes. Good encapsulation. Clear use of OOP principles appropriate to the language. Well-structured, logical design. Minor improvements possible but fundamentally sound. |
| **17-19 pts** (Good) | Adequate OOP usage. Classes present with reasonable design. Basic encapsulation. Some OOP principles demonstrated. Design is functional if not elegant. Shows understanding of core concepts. |
| **14-16 pts** (Satisfactory) | Basic OOP present. Classes exist but design could be better. Weak encapsulation (some public variables). Limited use of OOP features. More procedural than object-oriented in style. |
| **10-13 pts** (Needs Work) | Minimal OOP. Few classes or poorly designed. Little encapsulation. Doesn't demonstrate OOP principles well. Mostly procedural code. |
| **0-9 pts** (Poor) | No meaningful OOP. Code is entirely procedural. No classes or very poorly implemented. Doesn't show understanding of OOP concepts. |

**Score**: _____ / 25

**Classes Created**: ________________________________________________________________
