1. What is the output of the following code?

int a = 5;
int b = 4;
System.out.println((a + b) / 2);
System.out.println((a + b) / 2.0);

2. Why does (a + b) / 2 give a different result than (a + b) / 2.0?

3. Write a boolean expression that checks if a is greater than b.

4. What is the value of x after this code runs?

int x = 10;
x = x + 5 * 2;

5. List three Java primitive data types.
